This is a `flv` player. It was made by [Chris Brimelow](http://chrisbrimelow.com/blog/?p=15), and also includes the [caurina library](http://code.google.com/p/tweener/) (which probably shouldn't be deployed this way).

Flash for the video block is only used as a fallback in older browsers (old version of Internet Explorer mainly) &ndash; where possible the software will try to use a [HTML5 native video tag](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/video).

The future  remove of this flash fallback is discussed [here at issue #3497](https://github.com/concrete5/concrete5/issues/3497).
